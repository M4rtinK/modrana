Description: Highlights
        ==========
        
        - Re-use the same socket connection for multiple requests
          (``HTTPConnectionPool`` and ``HTTPSConnectionPool``)
          (with optional client-side certificate verification).
        - File posting (``encode_multipart_formdata``).
        - Built-in redirection and retries (optional).
        - Supports gzip and deflate decoding.
        - Thread-safe and sanity-safe.
        - Small and easy to understand codebase perfect for extending and building upon.
          For a more comprehensive solution, have a look at
          `Requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_.
        
        What's wrong with urllib and urllib2?
        =====================================
        
        There are two critical features missing from the Python standard library:
        Connection re-using/pooling and file posting. It's not terribly hard to
        implement these yourself, but it's much easier to use a module that already
        did the work for you.
        
        The Python standard libraries ``urllib`` and ``urllib2`` have little to do
        with each other. They were designed to be independent and standalone, each
        solving a different scope of problems, and ``urllib3`` follows in a similar
        vein.
        
        Why do I want to reuse connections?
        ===================================
        
        Performance. When you normally do a urllib call, a separate socket
        connection is created with each request. By reusing existing sockets
        (supported since HTTP 1.1), the requests will take up less resources on the
        server's end, and also provide a faster response time at the client's end.
        With some simple benchmarks (see `test/benchmark.py
        <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/test/benchmark.py>`_
        ), downloading 15 URLs from google.com is about twice as fast when using
        HTTPConnectionPool (which uses 1 connection) than using plain urllib (which
        uses 15 connections).
        
        This library is perfect for:
        
        - Talking to an API
        - Crawling a website
        - Any situation where being able to post files, handle redirection, and
          retrying is useful. It's relatively lightweight, so it can be used for
          anything!
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Go to `urllib3.readthedocs.org <http://urllib3.readthedocs.org>`_
        for more nice syntax-highlighted examples.
        
        But, long story short::
        
          import urllib3
        
          http = urllib3.PoolManager()
        
          r = http.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')
        
          print r.status, r.data
        
        The ``PoolManager`` will take care of reusing connections for you whenever
        you request the same host. For more fine-grained control of your connection
        pools, you should look at
        `ConnectionPool <http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/#connectionpool>`_.
        
        
        Run the tests
        =============
        
        Running the test command will install the necessary dependencies and run the
        tests. ::
        
          $ python setup.py test
          ...................................
        
        Success! Tests can also be run using ``nosetests`` for cleaner output.

        #. `Check for open issues <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/issues>`_ or open
           a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug. There is
           a *Contributor Friendly* tag for issues that should be ideal for people who
           are not very familiar with the codebase yet.
        #. Fork the `urllib3 repository on Github <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_
           to start making your changes.
        #. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works
           as expected.
        #. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.1 (2012-01-07)
        ++++++++++++++++
        
        * Refactored dummyserver to its own root namespace module (used for testing).
        
        * Added hostname verification for VerifiedHTTPSConnection by vendoring in Py32's
          ``ssl_match_hostname``. (Issue #25)
        
        * Fixed cross-host HTTP redirects when using PoolManager. (Issue #10)
        
        * Fixed ``decode_content`` being ignored when set through ``urlopen``. (Issue
          #27)
        
        * Fixed timeout-related bugs. (Issues #17, #23)
        
        
        1.0.2 (2011-11-04)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fixed typo in ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` which would only present as a bug if
          you're using the object manually. (Thanks pyos)
        
        * Made RecentlyUsedContainer (and consequently PoolManager) more thread-safe by
          wrapping the access log in a mutex. (Thanks @christer)
        
        * Made RecentlyUsedContainer more dict-like (corrected ``__delitem__`` and
          ``__getitem__`` behaviour), with tests. Shouldn't affect core urllib3 code.
        
        
        1.0.1 (2011-10-10)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fixed a bug where the same connection would get returned into the pool twice,
          causing extraneous "HttpConnectionPool is full" log warnings.
        
        
        1.0 (2011-10-08)
        ++++++++++++++++
        
        * Added ``PoolManager`` with LRU expiration of connections (tested and
          documented).
        * Added ``ProxyManager`` (needs tests, docs, and confirmation that it works
          with HTTPS proxies).
        * Added optional partial-read support for responses when
          ``preload_content=False``. You can now make requests and just read the headers
          without loading the content.
        * Made response decoding optional (default on, same as before).
        * Added optional explicit boundary string for ``encode_multipart_formdata``.
        * Convenience request methods are now inherited from ``RequestMethods``. Old
          helpers like ``get_url`` and ``post_url`` should be abandoned in favour of
          the new ``request(method, url, ...)``.
        * Refactored code to be even more decoupled, reusable, and extendable.
        * License header added to ``.py`` files.
        * Embiggened the documentation: Lots of Sphinx-friendly docstrings in the code
          and docs in ``docs/`` and on urllib3.readthedocs.org.
        * Embettered all the things!
        * Started writing this file.
        
        
        0.4.1 (2011-07-17)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Minor bug fixes, code cleanup.
        
        
        0.4 (2011-03-01)
