``upoints`` is a collection of `GPL v3`_ licensed modules for working with
points on Earth, or other near spherical objects.  It allows you to calculate
the distance and bearings between points, mangle xearth_/xplanet_ data files,
work with online UK trigpoint databases, NOAA_'s weather station database and
other such location databases.

The :mod:`upoints.point` module is the simplest interface available, and is
mainly useful as a naïve object for simple calculation and subclassing for
specific usage.  An example of how to use it follows:

>>> Home = point.Point(52.015, -0.221)
>>> Telford = point.Point(52.6333, -2.5000)
>>> int(Home.distance(Telford))
169
>>> int(Home.bearing(Telford))
294
>>> int(Home.final_bearing(Telford))
293
>>> import datetime
>>> Home.sun_events(datetime.date(2007, 6, 28))
(datetime.time(3, 42), datetime.time(20, 24))
>>> Home.sunrise(datetime.date(2007, 6, 28))
datetime.time(3, 42)
>>> Home.sunset(datetime.date(2007, 6, 28))
datetime.time(20, 24)
